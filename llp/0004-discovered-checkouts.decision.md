# LLP 0004: Checkouts Stim never ran in

## Discovery

Maintenance and `stim gc` also manage checkouts no `stim` command ran in. They
find them in three places: linked worktrees of the repositories of registered
projects (`git worktree list`), direct children of the folders that hold
registered checkouts, and direct children of the folders in
`maintenance.discoverRoots`. A child counts only when Stim's project detection
recognises it, itself or through a direct child of its `apps`, `examples` or
`packages` folder. Discovery registers nothing, writes nothing, recomputes each
run and never runs `git fetch`.

Reason: checkouts no `stim` command ran in can hold most of a disk; an audit of
one MacBook on 2026-11-11 found 119 of 151 checkouts, 248 GB, unknown to Stim,
among them a 150 GB Cargo `target/`.

Maintainer decision: "sounds good lets do it for automatic discovery! lets also
allow customizing by adding folders to look for projects in config", 2026-11-11.

Maintainer decision: "should be same rules as registered workspace",
2026-11-11, for discovered checkouts.

Which folders count as sources, the `apps`, `examples` and `packages` rule,
and the absence of any write or fetch were chosen by the coordinator and the
review of #5519, not by the maintainer.

## Scope

A discovered linked worktree is acted on only inside its repository's main
checkout folder, a folder that holds a known project, or a
`maintenance.discoverRoots` folder. Nothing under the system temporary directory
or a dot-folder directly inside the home directory is ever touched. The home
directory and `/` are never a folder that holds known projects. A scoped
`STIM_HOME` discovers only from its own `maintenance.discoverRoots`.

Reason: `git worktree list` also returns worktrees other tools own, such as
`~/.codex/worktrees`, pin checkouts under a home dot-folder and agent scratch
folders under the temporary directory. Stim cannot tell what those tools still
need. A scratch home must not reach the repositories of the real one.

Chosen by the coordinator and the review of #5519, not by the maintainer.

## Removing a discovered worktree needs more evidence

A discovered linked worktree follows the registered-workspace rules for build
outputs and dependencies. Removing the worktree itself needs more than a
registered worktree does, at every pressure level, critical included:

- no activity for `idle.dormantDays` by the full evidence (source writes
  including git-ignored files, last commit, git's own writes, a completed
  scan), with no zero grace, checked again under the removal locks;
- no process running from it and no agent session in it;
- no change to any tracked file. A registered worktree may lose a
  `Podfile.lock` change proven to be `pod install` output (LLP 0002); a
  discovered one gets no such exclusion;
- no tracked file marked `assume-unchanged`, or `skip-worktree` with the file
  on disk;
- every git-ignored file present byte for byte in the main checkout, except
  inside directories git ignores that are named like build output or
  `node_modules`;
- not inside a dot-folder of its main checkout other than `.worktrees`, such
  as `.claude/worktrees`, which another tool manages.

A dirty discovered worktree is kept, never archived. A checkout whose source
scan exceeds its bound is never reduced and is listed under "Needs a person".

Reason: Stim has no record of what it put in a discovered worktree. It did not
run `pod install` there, did not copy its ignored files with `worktree warm`,
and has no activity record for it, so a change it cannot explain may be a
person's work: a hand-written `.env`, a project file edited by hand, an edit
hidden from `git status`.
