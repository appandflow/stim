import StimTabs, { StimInstallTabs } from '@site/src/components/StimTabs';
import PromptBox, { PromptGrid } from '@site/src/components/PromptBox';

## Install Stim

Install the CLI globally or run it with npx. The package and command are both
`stim`. If you previously installed `stim-cli` globally, run
`npm uninstall --global stim-cli` first. The `@stim-cli/*` packages keep their
names.

<StimInstallTabs />

Install the bundled skill for your coding agent:

```bash
npx skills add appandflow/stim
```

The skill stays small and asks the installed CLI for version-specific guidance,
so upgrading Stim does not require reinstalling the skill.

## Ask the agent to run the app

Ask for the outcome:

<PromptBox
title="Build and run"
response={'Trailhead launched on stim-trailhead (iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5).\ncom.appandflow.trailhead · ready · cache hit · 58.8s · errors clean'}

>

{`Run the app on iOS.`}
</PromptBox>

You normally do not need to name Stim. Installing the skill lets a compatible
agent route build, run, device, log, and worktree requests to Stim. Say "use
Stim" only when you want to force that choice instead of a project-specific
wrapper.

The agent normally runs:

<StimTabs
code={`stim doctor           # inspect the source checkout and warm-state gaps
stim start            # start this workspace's dev server
stim ios              # build or restore, install, launch, and verify
stim logs --errors    # check for errors in the captured logs
stim stop             # release the live environment`}
/>

Use `stim android` for Android. Stim works with React Native Community CLI and
Expo projects. It needs no project initialization and writes no runtime state
into the repository.

After a build, the agent should report only the exact device and app, launch
state, cache result, total duration, and whether the error log is clean. Ask for
build-performance details when you want history across runs.

## Common prompts

Each prompt has a copy button and an illustrative agent response. Simulator
results use the Trailhead run above; device and PR flows show the same compact
reporting style.

<PromptGrid>
  <PromptBox
    title="Choose an iOS simulator"
response={`Trailhead launched on stim-trailhead (iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5).

  <PromptBox
    title="Use an EAS build"
    response={`Trailhead launched on stim-trailhead (iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5).

    {`Use Stim to run this app on an iOS simulator with the EAS profile ios-simulator. Reuse a compatible build. If none matches, show me the EAS build command and ask before starting a cloud build. Check the app logs for errors after launch.`}
  </PromptBox>
  <PromptBox
    title="Run on a connected phone"
    response={`Trailhead launched on the connected iPhone.

    {`Show app errors from the last 10 minutes.`}
  </PromptBox>
  <PromptBox

    response={`Trailhead is active on stim-trailhead (iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5).

  <PromptBox

  </PromptBox>
  <PromptBox
    title="Work in parallel"
    response={`Implemented on @janic/example in an isolated worktree.

  >
    {`Make this change in a separate worktree and validate it on iOS.`}
  </PromptBox>
  <PromptBox
    title="Record PR validation"
    response={`Validated the Trailhead Settings flow on iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5.

  </PromptBox>
</PromptGrid>

The EAS prompt assumes an `ios-simulator` profile. Replace it with your
project's profile name; see [EAS development builds](./eas-builds.md) for setup,
Android and device examples, and build-miss behavior.

## Run work in parallel

The current checkout is the default. An agent creates a separate worktree only
when the task needs isolation or parallel work, or when you ask for one:

<StimTabs
code={`git worktree add -b feature-name ../feature-name HEAD
cd ../feature-name
stim worktree warm
stim start
stim ios

# After the work is preserved:

stim stop
stim worktree remove`}
/>

If a harness already created the linked worktree, skip Git creation and run
`stim worktree warm` there. Warm copies missing ignored state from the source
checkout, including dependencies, native output, and eligible `.env` and local
config. Existing entries stay untouched. See
[worktree isolation](./worktrees.md) for exclusions and cleanup; removal works
whether or not the worktree was warmed.

The worktree gets a separate port and device. It can still use native and Metro
cache entries created by the source checkout or another worktree.

## What success means

`stim ios` and `stim android` install and open the app, then report launch
evidence. The summary includes the exact device, app identifier, cache result,
Metro state, launch state, and log path.

An OK summary without a launch qualifier confirms a bundle request or a live
release process. `bundle requested, still building` means Metro is still
working. For `launch UNVERIFIED`, follow the printed remedy before claiming
success. None of these checks proves that the screen rendered correctly.

Use a device automation tool only when the task requires visual interaction or
a screenshot. Stim owns the build and launch. It does not require a separate
device tool for that workflow.

## Next steps

- Read [Why Stim](/docs/why) for the design and benefits.
- Read the concept guides for caches, devices, logs, and worktrees.
- Use the [command reference](/docs/commands) for every command and option.
- Run `stim guide` for reference text that matches the installed version.
