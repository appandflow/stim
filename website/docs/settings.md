Commands use `stim`. If it is not installed globally, replace `stim` with
`npx stim-cli`.

Most projects need no settings. Use `stim guide settings` for descriptions that
match the installed version.

## Settings layers

Stim reads the first value found in this order:

1. Project settings in `~/.stim/config.json`, keyed by absolute path.
2. Repository settings in the same machine file, keyed by the git common dir.
3. Committed `.stim.json` at the repository root.
4. Machine defaults under top-level `optimizations` in `~/.stim/config.json` (for
   optimization settings only).
5. The Stim default.

Nested objects merge by key. Arrays replace lower-precedence arrays. Unknown
keys produce a warning. Every key below takes one type: a string, an array of
strings, a number, a boolean, or an object such as `android.avdConfig`,
`cache.options`, and the nested `optimizations` settings.
A value of the wrong type is refused by name on every command that resolves
settings, so a wrong shape never falls back to a default silently. `stim doctor`
reports it as a finding instead of refusing.

## Committed settings

`.stim.json` supports these keys:

| Key                           | Purpose                                                              |

| `android.variant`             | Gradle build variant                                                 |

| `metro.ngrokUrl`              | Existing ngrok URL                                                   |
| `metro.publicUrl`             | Existing public Metro URL                                            |
| `worktree.exclude`            | Ignored paths skipped by `worktree warm`                             |
| `cache.provider`              | Optional second-tier cache provider module                           |
| `cache.options`               | Options passed to that provider                                      |
| `caches`                      | Additional cache paths reported by `gc`                              |
| `optimizations`               | [Build optimization switches and defaults](./build-optimizations.md) |

`worktree warm` reads settings from the main checkout. A nonempty
`.worktreeexclude` in main replaces its resolved `worktree.exclude` setting;
an empty or absent file uses the setting.

Do not put secrets in a committed `.stim.json`. Keep secrets in ignored files
and carry those files into a worktree.

`cache.provider` names a module that Stim executes in every worktree on the
repository. Review a committed value the way you review a build script, and
keep provider credentials in the environment or in machine settings. Stim reads
the module for `stim ios` and `stim android`; Metro uses it only when the
project's own `metro.config.js` calls `sharedCacheStores()` from
`@stim-cli/metro`.

### Android AVD overrides

`android.avdConfigFile` reads an Android `config.ini` file. `android.avdConfig`
provides the same safe keys as JSON. Stim applies these values only when it
creates a new owned AVD. It never rewrites an existing AVD or changes generated
identity and storage paths.

The validated keys cover CPU count, RAM, heap size, screen density, graphics,
orientation, network conditions, and common hardware switches. On displayless Linux,
Stim also launches the emulator with `-no-window -noaudio -no-boot-anim`.
Run `stim guide settings` for the complete key and value list.

## Machine settings

`~/.stim/config.json` also supports:

```json
{
  "concurrency": { "maxBuilds": 2, "maxDevices": 3 },
  "pool": { "iosParkedMax": 3, "androidParkedMax": 3 },
  "caches": {
    "buildCache": "/Volumes/Cache/stim/build-cache",
    "metroCache": "/Volumes/Cache/stim/metro-cache"
  }
}
```

`pool.iosParkedMax` bounds the simulators `worktree remove` parks for a later
workspace to adopt. Absent means 3; `0` turns parking and adoption off. When
`STIM_HOME` is set, parking is off unless `STIM_POOL_IOS_PARKED_MAX` is set too.
`pool.androidParkedMax` and `STIM_POOL_ANDROID_PARKED_MAX` apply the same rules
to Android emulators. See [owned devices](/docs/owned-devices) for adoption cleanup.

The committed `.stim.json` `caches` key and this machine-file `caches` key are
different shapes: the committed key is an array of extra paths for `gc` to
report, and this machine-file key is an object of named cache locations.

Use a top-level [`optimizations` object](./build-optimizations.md) in this file to
control build optimizations on this machine without changing project files.

## Environment variables

| Variable                       | Purpose                                                                                                  |

| `STIM_MAX_BUILDS`              | Maximum concurrent native builds                                                                         |
| `STIM_MAX_DEVICES`             | Maximum booted owned devices                                                                             |
| `STIM_POOL_ANDROID_PARKED_MAX` | Maximum parked Android emulators; 0 disables parking and adoption                                        |
| `STIM_POOL_IOS_PARKED_MAX`     | Maximum parked simulators                                                                                |
| `STIM_METRO_PUBLIC_URL`        | Public Metro URL for remote use                                                                          |
| `STIM_ANDROID_CAS_TOOLCHAIN`   | Absolute path to the [Android CAS toolchain manifest](./build-optimizations.md#experimental-android-cas) |

Proxy remote devices also use `AGENT_DEVICE_DAEMON_BASE_URL` and
`AGENT_DEVICE_DAEMON_AUTH_TOKEN`. Those variables belong to the optional proxy
service, not to Stim.
