import StimTabs from '@site/src/components/StimTabs';

Commands use `stim`. If it is not installed globally, replace `stim` with
`npx stim-cli`.

Stim shares four types of work across projects and git worktrees:

| Layer                    | What it avoids                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Native artifact cache    | A complete iOS or Android build when native inputs match  |
| Xcode compilation cache  | Recompiling unchanged native units on an artifact miss    |
| Gradle caches and output | Repeating Android dependency and task work                |
| Metro transform cache    | Transforming the same JavaScript modules in each worktree |

See [build optimizations](./build-optimizations.md) for switches, defaults, and
tradeoffs for each layer, including Android ccache, PCH, and experimental CAS.

## Native artifact cache

Stim uses `@expo/fingerprint` to identify native inputs in both Expo and bare
React Native projects. The cache key also includes the platform, target, and
build configuration or variant.

`stim ios` and `stim android` first check the machine-wide artifact cache. A hit
installs the saved `.app` or `.apk`. A miss runs the native build and stores the
result. Two matching misses use one build through a single-flight lock.

Release configurations use separate keys. On a cache hit for an iOS simulator
or Android target, Stim regenerates the current workspace's JavaScript and
assets in a copy of the artifact. If that swap fails, it builds fresh. iOS
physical-device Release runs always build fresh.

### Optional artifact providers

The provider integration is implemented, but Stim ships no network provider
or hosted cache service. Without a configured provider, artifacts stay on the
local machine.

Projects can supply a module through `cache.provider` using the
[`@stim-cli/cache` contract](https://github.com/appandflow/stim/tree/main/packages/cache),
or use a configured Expo `buildCacheProvider`, such as `eas`.
`optimizations.remoteBuildCache` controls whether Stim uses those providers.
Provider and build-profile restrictions still apply; see
[build optimizations](./build-optimizations.md#compare-compiler-settings).
This caches app artifacts; ccache and Clang CAS use separate compiler caches.

## Keep the main checkout warm

Run `stim doctor` before native worktree work. It checks whether the main
checkout has current dependencies and CocoaPods state. On a checkout without
installed dependencies, it also checks whether a fresh worktree produces the
same native fingerprint.

When several native tasks are coming, build the main checkout once:

<StimTabs
code={`stim start
stim ios                  # or: stim android
stim stop`}
/>

Later worktrees can reuse that cache entry. In an existing linked worktree,
`stim worktree warm` copies missing ignored state from main without replacing
existing entries. This includes installed dependencies, Pods, and native
output. See [worktree isolation](./worktrees.md) for its full scope.

## Inspect and clean caches

<StimTabs
code={`stim gc
stim gc --delete --older-than 30
stim gc --delete --cache all`}
/>

The first command only reports sizes. Age-based cleanup removes unused entries.
`--cache all` empties managed caches and makes future builds cold; it reaps
nothing, so `gc --delete` on its own remains the way to prune stale entries.
`--cache "compilation cache"` empties one cache instead of every one.

Set `STIM_BUILD_CACHE` or `STIM_METRO_CACHE` to place the shared caches on a
different volume. The same values can live in the machine config under
`caches.buildCache` and `caches.metroCache`.
