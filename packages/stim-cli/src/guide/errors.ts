  Nothing that could be proven to be THIS workspace's dev server holds the
  reserved port -- or no port is reserved at all. The gate fires in about a
  second, before the device is even booted, rather than after four minutes of
  compiling an app that could not load a bundle. Run \`stim start\` first.
  \`--no-metro-check\` overrides it and wires the app to the reservation (or to
  8081 when there is none). A non-Debug \`ios --configuration\` never emits
  this: a release-shaped build embeds its JS, so the gate does not run at all.
  A port held by SOMETHING ELSE reports what: usually a bundler started from
  the wrong directory (the repo root instead of the app dir in a monorepo), or
  another repo's Metro. Restart it from inside the project, or free the port
  and run \`stim start\` to get a fresh reservation.

    STIM_DEPS_FAILED: {
      summary: 'pod install or gradle sync failed; the bundler ladder and BUNDLE_FROZEN',
      body: () => `STIM_DEPS_FAILED
  \`pod install\` (iOS) or the gradle dependency sync (Android) failed. On iOS
  this runs only when Podfile.lock and Pods/Manifest.lock disagree, or Pods is
  absent -- which is exactly what a carried worktree produces.
  WHICH POD COMMAND: when the project root has a Gemfile and a Gemfile.lock
  that resolves cocoapods, pods go through bundler -- \`bundle check --dry-run\`,
  then \`bundle install\` only when that reports missing gems, then \`bundle exec
  pod install\` -- so the CocoaPods the lockfile pins is the one that writes
  Podfile.lock. Everything else gets plain \`pod install\`: no Gemfile, a Gemfile
  with no Gemfile.lock (\`bundle install\` would CREATE that tracked file in
  your checkout, which Stim will not do), and a Gemfile.lock that
  pins something other than pods, such as a fastlane-only bundle. When
  \`bundle\` is not on PATH the run prints one dim \`pods\` note and uses plain
  \`pod install\`. The \`pods\` phase line always names the command that ran, and
  the gem steps heartbeat under the \`gems\` label.
  Bundler runs with BUNDLE_FROZEN, so a Gemfile that no longer matches its
  Gemfile.lock FAILS the build rather than quietly falling back to unpinned
  pods -- silently using a different CocoaPods than the lockfile pins is the
  bug this path exists to kill. Run \`bundle install\` yourself and keep the
  result. Gems themselves are installed wherever BUNDLE_PATH points -- the
  project's own \`.bundle/config\` (vendor/bundle in the React Native template),
  or the environment. When that lands inside the project, Stim says so in a dim
  note naming which of the two set it; Gemfile.lock is never edited either way.
  \`worktree warm --refresh\` reports the same code for the install it runs in
  the SOURCE CHECKOUT -- the lockfile's own command (\`pnpm install\`,
  \`yarn install\`, \`bun install\`, \`npm ci\`) or that same pod ladder. The
  message names the command, quotes its last lines, and nothing is copied: fix
  the source checkout, then warm again.`,
    },
    STIM_BUILD_FAILED: {
      summary: 'xcodebuild or gradle failed; the two Android APK refusals; a damaged compilation-cache object',
      body: () => `STIM_BUILD_FAILED
  xcodebuild or gradle failed. The EXTRACTED diagnostics are printed (capped),
  not the transcript. Read the log path on the next line for the rest.
  Two Android refusals share this code without gradle itself failing:
  - MORE THAN ONE debug APK under android/app/build/outputs/apk and nothing
    configured to pick one (a project with product flavors, several flavors
    already built). Stim will not guess which flavor to install: the
    refusal lists the candidates -- pass \`--variant <name>\` or set the
    android.variant setting (e.g. "productionDebug") to the one you want.
    Flavors declared plainly in android/app/build.gradle are caught before
    the build instead (STIM_BAD_ARG); this one remains for the declarations
    that parse cannot read.
  - NO APK for the configured variant: the android.variant / --variant value
    does not name a real variant (\`./gradlew :app:tasks\` in android/ lists
    the assemble tasks).
  AN APK OLDER THAN THE BUILD IS NOT A REFUSAL. \`assembleDebug\` packages every
  flavor, so a later \`--variant previewDebug\` finds a current APK that gradle
  reports UP-TO-DATE and repackages nothing. Stim installs it. Gradle owns task
  freshness and the fingerprint owns cache freshness; Stim does not second-guess
  either from the file's mtime.

"failed to scan dependencies for source ..." on pods you did not touch  (ios)
  The compilation cache holds a damaged object. Xcode reports it per source
  file, so it names whichever targets reach the object first -- often pods such
  as sqlite3, nanopb or libwebp -- and the list changes between runs. The
  transcript carries the cause:
    error: CAS-based dependency scan failed: not a IncludeTreeRoot node kind
  A cache write that a full disk or a killed build cut short leaves such an
  object, and upgrading the CLI does not clear it. Empty that one cache with
  \`gc --delete --cache "compilation cache"\`, then build again. The next
  build is a cold one.`,
    },
    fallbacks: {
      summary: 'release cache-hit notes that are not codes: swap failure, asset gate, uninstall, device fallbacks',
      body: () => `FALLBACK NOTES THAT ARE NOT CODES (release cache hits)
  On a release cache hit Stim regenerates this workspace's JS bundle into a
  COPY of the cached artifact before installing it -- \`ios --configuration
  Release\` into a copy of the .app, \`android --variant ...Release\` into a
  copy of the APK. When any step of that swap fails (the bundle command,
  hermesc, the re-sign, zipalign, apksigner), the run does NOT install the
  cached artifact -- its baked-in JS is the builder's, not yours -- and does
  NOT fail: it prints a \`swap        failed at <step>: ... --
  building fresh instead\` note on stderr and falls back to a full build. If
  the run then fails, the code is the build's own (STIM_BUILD_FAILED etc.);
  the swap note above it says why the cache hit was not used. A swap that
  merely finds no hermesc notes it and embeds the plain JS bundle instead --
  that is a note, not a fallback.

  ANDROID'S ASSET GATE is the second, and it is not a failure at all. Before
  re-packing, Stim compares this workspace's freshly emitted asset tree
  against the assets the cached APK carries. Any added, removed or changed
  asset prints

    swap        this workspace's asset set differs from the cached APK's
                (1 added, 0 changed, 0 removed; e.g. added
                res/drawable-mdpi/new_logo.png) -- building fresh instead

  and the run does a full gradle build. There is nothing to fix: a drawable
  has a row in resources.arsc that only AAPT can write, so an APK cannot be
  made to carry an asset it was not built with, and installing one whose JS
  references a missing asset would 404 at runtime. Add an image, pay for one
  full build; the APK it produces becomes the new cache entry.

  THE UNINSTALL NOTE is the third, and it COSTS THE APP'S DATA. A re-packed
  APK is signed with this machine's debug keystore, so the moment it meets a
  copy signed by CI the install is refused with
  INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE (or INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE) and
  nothing but removing the package resolves it. A RELEASE run therefore
  uninstalls the package once, retries the install once, and prints

    install     com.example.app was already installed with a different signer,
                so it was uninstalled (its data went with it) before this APK
                could be installed

  Debug runs never do this. A debug run meets the conflict on a physical
  device that already carries a store build, and there the colliding package is
  the user's real app: losing its data to a silent uninstall would be a worse
  bug than the one it fixes. A debug run fails with STIM_INSTALL_FAILED and
  hands you the uninstall to run yourself.

  ON A PHONE the same uninstall costs one thing more: iOS drops the Settings >
  General > VPN & Device Management trust entry when the last app from that
  developer goes, and it clears the app's Local Network permission with it. The
  note says so, because the reinstall succeeds and then the LAUNCH is refused
  until someone taps Trust again. The retry is one uninstall and one install --
  it is not a way around a tap that has no API.

  THE DEVICE FALLBACKS are the fourth, and both print a \`cache\` note and
  build fresh rather than failing:

    cache       a cached Release device app carries its builder's JS, and the
                device JS swap lands with phase 6 of appandflow/stim#178 --
                building fresh instead, which bakes in this workspace's JS

  and a signing-gate refusal on a CACHED artifact -- an expired or foreign
  profile, a phone the profile does not name, an identity this keychain does not
  hold -- which prints the gate's own reason with \`-- building fresh instead\`.
  The same refusal on a FRESHLY BUILT app is a code (STIM_NO_PROFILE,
  STIM_PROFILE_MISMATCH, STIM_NO_SIGNING_IDENTITY), not a note: building again
  would produce the same app and refuse again.`,
    },
    STIM_BUILD_WAIT_TIMEOUT: {
      summary: "waited ~90 minutes for another workspace's build of the same fingerprint",
      body: () => `STIM_BUILD_WAIT_TIMEOUT
  This run was waiting for ANOTHER workspace's build of the same fingerprint
  (see \`guide lifecycle concurrency\`), and no artifact arrived within ~90
  minutes.
  Replacement builders share that deadline, including time spent acquiring
  the lock between waits. A live builder may be wedged, or successive builders
  may have failed. The message names the current pid and lock directory:
  check the pid, and if it is not really building, remove that directory and
  run the command again.`,
    },
    STIM_CLAIM_REFUSED: {
      summary: 'a build lock exists whose holder cannot be identified; Stim neither removes it nor waits on it',
      body: () => `STIM_CLAIM_REFUSED
  A build lock records the holder's process IDENTITY, not just its pid, so a
  recycled pid reads as a gone builder rather than a live one, and a builder
  busy in a long \`simctl\` or gradle call reads as live rather than as stale.
  This code is the one state that cannot be decided: the claim file is truncated
  or not JSON, its identity token does not decode, or the holder spawned the
  process doing the work and was killed before recording which one.
  Stim will not remove a claim it cannot prove is dead, and it will not wait on
  one either -- a silent wait on a lock nobody holds is what this replaces. The
  message names the claim and the exact, shell-quoted removal that clears it --
  just that claim's file, not the lock directory around it; run that, then
  run the command again. Nothing was built, installed or removed.
  \`worktree warm\` reports it for the repository-wide warm claim under
  ~/.stim/warm-locks on both paths, including a \`--refresh\` that spawned its
  install and was killed before recording which process: nothing was refreshed
  and nothing was copied. One case is NOT this code for a plain warm: a
  STIM_HOME (or a warm-locks path under it) that is a file rather than a
  directory. No claim can be stored there at all, which is a filesystem state
  that predates claims, so plain \`warm\` degrades to the unsynchronised copy it
  performed before them and \`--refresh\` still refuses.`,
    },
    STIM_CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE: {
      summary: 'this process has no recordable identity, so no build lock or build slot can be taken at all',
      body: () => `STIM_CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE
  Every ownership claim records the holder's process identity, captured through
  the \`unique-pid\` native module. This code is that capture failing: no
  prebuilt binary for this platform and architecture, or the OS refusing to
  report this process's start identity.
  Stim refuses rather than building without a claim. A run with no claim is
  invisible to every other run, so the single-flight lock and
  concurrency.maxBuilds would both be off at once, and two builds could compile
  the same fingerprint while each believed it was alone. Reinstall Stim so the
  module for this platform is present, then run the command again. Nothing was
  built, installed or removed.
  \`worktree warm --refresh\` refuses for the same reason, because it writes to
  the source checkout. Plain \`worktree warm\` does NOT: it prints one dim
  \`lock        unavailable (...)\` line and copies unsynchronised. A copy only
  reads, so running it with no claim is what it did before the lock existed,
  while refusing it would break a warm that works today -- an unwritable
  STIM_HOME included.
  It still reads the claim set first, which takes no claim: a live \`--refresh\`
  claim, or a claim it cannot resolve, makes even the unsynchronised copy
  refuse, and the line names what it found. Only a repository nothing is
  warming is copied without a claim.`,
    },
    STIM_INSTALL_FAILED: {
      summary: 'simctl, adb, or devicectl refused the artifact; the one signer-conflict retry',
      body: () => `STIM_INSTALL_FAILED
  The artifact built or came from cache, but \`simctl install\` / \`adb install\` /
  \`devicectl device install app\` refused it. A signature or architecture
  mismatch, or a full device.
  On a PHONE (\`ios --device\`) the message carries devicectl's own text and the
  remedy names the cause it recognises: the phone is locked, the host is not
  trusted, Developer Mode is off, storage is full, or the app already on the
  phone was signed by a different team. Only that last one is retried -- one
  \`devicectl device uninstall app\`, one reinstall, and a warning that the
  app's data went with it -- along with the phone's developer trust and its
  Local Network permission, which iOS clears on an uninstall, so the launch
  after it may need the trust tap again. This is gated on \`--device\` rather
  than on the configuration, because every device run is signed, Debug
  included.
  On Android a signature or downgrade conflict names the package that is really
  installed -- the built APK's applicationId, which on a flavored project is
  the flavor's id and not the gradle namespace -- and gives you the
  \`adb -s <serial> uninstall <applicationId>\` that clears it. Re-running after
  that is a cache hit: one install, no build.`,
    },
    STIM_LAUNCH_FAILED: {
      summary: 'installed but would not start; the developer-trust tap on a phone',
      body: () => `STIM_LAUNCH_FAILED
  Installed, but the app would not start. On Android this usually means no
  launchable activity resolved.
  On a local iOS simulator, a timed-out launch can mean the simulator cannot
  spawn processes, even while it reports Booted. Check the reported memory
  pressure and free host memory before retrying; a timeout alone is not an OOM
  diagnosis. See \`stim guide lifecycle simslim\` for recovery and the optional
  SimSlim recommendation.
  On a PHONE it means the app never appeared in the device's own process list
  after \`devicectl device process launch\`, and the devicectl lines that
  explain it are quoted under the message. The refusal a first launch usually
  hits is the DEVELOPER TRUST one -- SpringBoard reports
  FBSOpenApplicationErrorDomain 3 with the reason Security -- and its remedy is
  the only one a human has to perform on the phone: Settings > General >
  VPN & Device Management, tap the developer profile under DEVELOPER APP, tap
  Trust, then run the command again. It is a per-developer-certificate tap, not
  a per-build one -- but an uninstall clears it, including the one Stim's own
  signer-conflict retry performs.`,

  An app that has not been granted Local Network reaches nothing on the LAN,
  and CFNetwork reports each attempt as NSURLErrorDomain -1009 "The Internet
  connection appears to be offline." with the path reason

    _NSURLErrorNWPathKey=unsatisfied (Local network prohibited)

  THAT REASON IS THE WHOLE MATCH. The rest of the block -- POSIX error 50
  (ENETDOWN), \`failed to connect 1:50\`, \`error code: -1009 [1:50]\` -- is
  generic and says nothing about the permission: Wi-Fi turned off gives the
  identical errno with the reason \`unsatisfied (No network route)\`, and a
  cellular-only route gives \`unsatisfied (Denied over cellular interface)\`.
  Matching those would print this remedy at a phone that simply is not on the
  network, and would drop the same-SSID check that is the actual fix, so they
  are not matched.
  THE PROMPT AND A PRIOR DENIAL READ THE SAME. iOS emits this reason while the
  prompt is unanswered and after a Don't Allow, which persists across upgrade
  installs. The remedy covers both: if the first \`alert get\` finds no alert,
  it was denied earlier and the only fix is the switch under Settings > Privacy
  & Security > Local Network, which has no API.
  The reason is read out of THIS launch's device records -- since the launch,
  and from the app's pid when it is known. It is NOT origin-scoped: the record
  that carries the reason carries no URL (the failing URL lands in a
  continuation line with no process prefix, which the pid filter drops), so
  scoping to this workspace's Metro origin would never fire. That is sound
  anyway, because the permission gates every LAN connection the app makes, so
  even a third-party SDK's prohibited connection proves the app cannot reach
  this workspace's Metro either. Matching only picks the remedy: no record's
  level changes, so the device source stays out of \`logs --errors\`
  (\`guide logs\`: severity is never guessed on a phone).
  When it matches, \`launched: "unverified"\` leads with that evidence and with
  the recovery, in this order:

    agent-device alert get --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device alert accept --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device snapshot -i --platform ios --udid <udid>
    agent-device press 'label="Reload"' --platform ios --udid <udid>

  \`alert get\` reads the alert without opening anything, so it works while the
  app sits behind it. THE GRANT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH: the dev client does not
  retry, and stays on "Failed to load app ... The Internet connection appears
  to be offline." with a Reload button, which is why the last two lines are
  there. The text form of the press target is \`label="Reload"\` (or
  \`text="Reload"\`); a bare \`press "Reload"\` is rejected. Stim's own launch
  ends in \`-- -EXDevMenuShowsAtLaunch 0 -EXDevMenuShowFloatingActionButton 0\`,
  so the Expo dev menu is not over the app, fresh install or not. An app started
  ANOTHER way does not carry those arguments and \`snapshot -i\` can show the
  menu instead: \`agent-device press 'label="Close"'\` dismisses it, then press
  Reload. See \`guide facts devmenu\`.

  A BARE APP (no expo-dev-client) gets the same first two commands and a
  different third. The prompt fires the same way, because it is fired by any
  LAN connection to the Metro host, and the path reason is CFNetwork's either
  way -- the classifier reads that reason alone and knows nothing about dev
  clients. What differs is the screen: a bare app is expected to show React
  Native's RedBox, "Could not connect to development server". Read the screen
  with \`agent-device snapshot -i\` and press Reload by the ref or label it
  reports; neither that text nor the button's accessibility label has been read
  off hardware.

  \`agent-device metro reload\` does NOT recover either screen. It only reaches
  an app already connected to Metro's websocket, and an app stopped by this
  permission never connected.

  Without agent-device,
  \`xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <udid> --terminate-existing
  [--payload-url '<devClientUrl>'] <bundleId>
  [-- -EXDevMenuShowsAtLaunch 0 -EXDevMenuShowFloatingActionButton 0]\`
  also recovers, and it costs the device log:
  it replaces the process the collector follows, so
  \`stim logs --source device\` stops for the rest of that run. For a dev
  client, pressing Reload is cheaper and keeps the collector alive. For a bare
  app the relaunch is the cleanest recovery, because it re-reads ip.txt. By
  hand it is two taps either way: Allow, then Reload.

  WHAT HAS ACTUALLY RUN: the dev-client path above was performed on a phone --
  the alert, the accept, the unchanged error screen, the Reload press, and the
  bundle that followed. The bare path has NOT been exercised on hardware; there
  is no provisioned bare project to run it on. Its signature and its remedy are
  reasoned from the same CFNetwork evidence and from React Native's own
  RedBox, not observed.

  THE OTHER ONE-TIME TAP HAS NO API. The developer-trust tap (Settings >
  General > VPN & Device Management) is refused to automation by the same gate
  that refuses the app, agent-device's own runner included, so its remedy is
  "ask the user" and nothing else. An uninstall clears both.`,

    STIM_NO_DEVICE: {
      summary: 'no usable phone, or the owned simulator or emulator could not be created or booted',
      separator: '--- DEVICE AND CAPACITY CODES ---',
      body: () => `STIM_NO_DEVICE
  With \`--device\`, no physical device answered the selection: none connected,
  a named serial/UDID that is not connected, several connected with none named
  (the refusal lists them), or one that is connected but unusable -- an
  unauthorized Android device, or an iPhone that is unpaired or has Developer
  Mode off. Hardware is never created or booted, so there is nothing to retry
  into existence: fix the cable, the trust prompt, or Developer Mode.
  Otherwise the owned simulator/emulator could not be created or could not
  reach a booted state. \`stim doctor\` checks the toolchain; \`stim status\` says what
  Stim thinks it owns. Re-running the command creates a fresh owned device
  when the recorded one is gone.
  If Android creation says an AVD already exists on disk but is not listed,
  run \`npx stim gc\` to inspect orphaned owned AVDs, then \`npx stim gc --delete\`
  to reclaim those safe to delete before retrying. Keep anything GC cannot
  verify; do not delete AVD directories by hand. A registered unrecorded owned
  AVD is recovered, reusing its existing emulator when its identity is verified.
  If recovery cannot verify registration or process state, inspect \`npx stim status\`
  and \`adb devices\`, then retry after any other run finishes. Keep the AVD and
  its process locks while its state is unverified.
  On iOS a slow first boot is waited out for up to ten minutes while the
  simulator reports Booting or Booted but bootstatus has not completed.
  Booted alone does not end that wait. The failure names the udid and the wait.
  After boot, a process-spawn probe must finish within 30 seconds before
  installation. If it fails, the refusal includes observed host memory pressure
  when available. Free memory before retrying under pressure; see
  \`stim guide lifecycle simslim\`. Booted alone does not prove readiness.
  On Android the emulator's own stdio is captured to
  the global workspace logs/emulator.log (truncated per boot), and when it printed a
  \`FATAL |\` / \`ERROR |\` / \`PANIC:\` line THAT is the message and the remedy
  you get -- the disk-space refusal ("Not enough space to create userdata
  partition") is the case this exists for. The generic toolchain remedy above
  is only what you see when neither the log nor the failure itself identifies
  the cause. An ENOSPC failure points at disk space instead: owned Android AVDs
  normally live under ~/.android/avd, and a booted AVD can use several GB. A
  boot whose emulator process exited is also reported at once rather than after
  the full cold-boot timeout.

"this project's sim is X, but --device-type asked for Y"
  The project already owns a simulator of a different model, and Stim will
  not silently boot a different one. Reap it (\`worktree remove\`, or
  \`gc --delete\`) and run \`stim ios\` again to create the requested model.
  That loses the old sim's app state.`,

  workspaces build the same app id, that install terminates the app the holder
  is running. Two other cases refuse with this code and no wait at all: a lease
  file that does not parse (\`lease\` fields null, the file named -- nothing may
  take that device until it is dealt with), and this workspace's OWN lease with

  METRO DID NOT ANSWER. The probe timed out after 2 seconds, or the socket
  errored. Nothing is known about the app, so the remedy is to run the same
  reload again, and to check the dev server with stim doctor if it keeps
  timing out. Do not touch the device for this one.

  METRO REPORTS NO PEER FOR THE APP. Stim broadcasts a reload anyway before
  giving up, because matching is best-effort and an unmatched peer may still be
  this app, so VERIFY THE UI FIRST -- the app may already have recovered. If it
  did not, retry: a client reconnects to Metro every 2 seconds, which is also
  this probe's timeout, so a single miss can be a reconnect window rather than
  an app that never connected. If it stays unreachable on iOS, an error in the
  first bundle leaves the app without a packager connection at all and no retry
  will make it a peer. The remedy then routes the agent to the device's own
  controls in its existing automation session: press the error screen's Reload
  button, or open the dev menu and press Reload when no error screen is
  showing. The printed agent-device open command is the last resort; it
  relaunches that app on that device with this workspace's Metro port and loses
  in-memory state. Keep the existing --session flag and verify afterward.

  When it does refuse, the refusal PRINTS THE DIRTY PATHS, and the restore
  command under it carries those same paths: run it as printed rather than
  reaching for --force.
  It is built from what git reported, so in a monorepo it names
  \`apps/<app>/ios/Podfile.lock\` rather than an \`ios/...\` example that would
  fail with "did not match any file(s) known to git".
  A setup script that rewrites tracked assets (brand icons, generated config)
  produces the same refusal, with the same treatment: restore the paths the
  refusal actually named.
  Use --force only when you genuinely intend to discard work; it deletes
  uncommitted and untracked files permanently.`,

  \`worktree warm\` refuses to copy dependencies the source checkout never
  finished installing. \`--refresh\` records a COMPLETED install of the lockfile
  it read under ~/.stim/warm-installs; an install that failed, or whose process
  was killed, leaves that record saying unfinished. A plain warm reads it after
  it takes its claim and before it copies, and this code is what it prints when
  the unfinished install is of the lockfile AS IT STANDS NOW. Without it the
  copy carries a partial node_modules and exits 0, and nothing else in the run
  says so: the refresh reported its own STIM_DEPS_FAILED in its own terminal,
  and a refresh that was killed reported nothing anywhere. Nothing was copied.
  Run \`stim worktree warm --refresh\`: it reinstalls rather than skipping for
  exactly the same record, and a plain warm copies once that install completes.
  Two states deliberately do NOT produce this code. A record of a DIFFERENT
  lockfile says nothing about the one on disk now, whose dependencies may well
  have been installed since; and a repository with no record at all -- every
  repository before its first \`--refresh\` -- copies as it always has.
  In a monorepo the record is keyed on the directory that owns the lockfile,
  which is usually the repository root, so every app of it reads the same one.`,

  A STIM_HOME that \`--refresh\` cannot write. The refusal itself is right -- it
  writes to the source checkout, so it will not run without a claim -- but it
  carries no \`failed: <CODE>\` line, because EACCES is not a Stim code, and no
  fix line. Make STIM_HOME writable, or set STIM_HOME to somewhere writable,
  then run it again. A plain warm degrades in this state rather than refusing.

"... the claim path is a file, not a claim directory", with a \`rm -rf\` that
changes nothing  (worktree warm --refresh)
  When \`$STIM_HOME/warm-locks\` or STIM_HOME itself is a regular FILE, the
  refusal names \`warm-locks/<name>.lock\` -- a path that cannot exist under a
  file -- so running the printed removal does nothing and the next run refuses
  identically. Remove the file that is in the way and run it again. A plain
  warm copies unsynchronised in this state.

  Both are documented rather than fixed: appandflow/stim#696.`,

    carry: {
      summary: 'worktree warm copy results, lockfile mismatches, and remedies',
      body: () => `"carry       incomplete: ... ignored entries copied, ... kept, ... failed"
(worktree warm)
  At least one entry could not be copied. The command exits 1 and names each
  failure. Existing entries stay untouched; any files already published remain.
  Inspect failed paths before retrying, because existing directories are skipped
  whole. "complete" means the eligible copy finished, not that dependencies
  are installed or match this branch. Progress and results go to stderr,
  with empty stdout.

"carry       carried <dir>/Pods does not match the <dir>/Podfile.lock on disk here"
  Warm copied ignored Pods from the source checkout, but their Manifest.lock
  differs from the tracked Podfile.lock in this worktree. Warm does not change
  tracked files. Run the printed pod-install command before building directly.
  \`stim ios\` detects a mismatch and runs \`pod install\` for you.

"carry       carried <dir>/Pods but there is no <dir>/Podfile.lock"
  Warm copied Pods but the destination has no Podfile.lock. Follow the printed
  pod-install command before building.

"carry       carried dependencies may be stale: they do not match ..."
  The source checkout's lockfile differs from this branch's lockfile. Run the
  printed package-manager command before building. A carry whose lockfile
  matches is silent; the warning means a real difference.

  If the source checkout has no dependencies to copy, use this project's
  package manager to install them. Warm does not install dependencies or prove
  the app is ready, unless \`--refresh\` installed them in the SOURCE CHECKOUT
  first; even then the copy can still carry a lockfile this branch does not
  have, which is exactly what these carry warnings report.`,

  The repo probably pins a private registry in \`.npmrc\`, so \`npx\` looked for

    npx --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org stim <command>

  A line such as \`npm warn exec ... will be installed\` is normal when using
  the no-install form.

"Unsupported engine" or a syntax error before Stim starts
  Stim requires Node 20.19.4 or later on Node 20, or Node 22.12.0 or later.
  Switch Node versions, then run the command again.


"Found no free Metro port between ..."
  200 consecutive ports are claimed or occupied. \`stim status\` shows what
  Stim knows about; the rest is other software.

  Several commands raced for the same ports and each one lost. Nothing is

    sandbox: {
      summary: 'running under a sandboxing harness: EPERM under STIM_HOME, CoreSimulatorService, adb',
      body: () => `RUNNING UNDER A SANDBOX

  An agent harness that sandboxes shell commands typically permits writes
  inside the project and blocks the rest. Three things Stim needs sit outside
  that boundary, and none of the failures names the sandbox:

    EPERM: operation not permitted, mkdir '<STIM_HOME>/workspaces/...'
      writes to STIM_HOME (~/.stim unless set)

    CoreSimulatorService connection became invalid   (macOS)
    Unable to locate device set: ... Code=61 "Connection refused"
      the simulator service simctl talks to over XPC

    ADB server didn't ACK
    could not install *smartsocket* listener: Operation not permitted
      the adb server socket on tcp:5037

  Measured on Claude Code and on Codex: the three fail the same way in both,
  so this is the shape of the problem, not one harness's quirk. Codex also
  blocks network egress by default, which breaks a cache lookup and a fetch.

  \`stim doctor\` names this when a write to STIM_HOME actually fails, not
  merely when a harness that can sandbox is present. \`stim doctor --fix\`
  writes only when the report shows that finding, and only what the finding
  names: the three keys, into .claude/settings.local.json, the per-user file,
  merging with what is there. A report without the finding, with or without
  --platform, leaves that file alone. It refuses under Codex, which
  has no per-path allowance to add, and refuses any settings file it cannot
  parse rather than replace it: comments make one unparseable here even though
  Claude Code accepts them. Claude Code reads project settings from the
  directory a session starts in, so in a monorepo the file has to sit at that
  root to count, and a file written inside a worktree goes when the worktree
  does.

  Two ways out, and choosing at the start of a session beats discovering it
  three failures in. Either run Stim with the harness's sandbox disabled, or
  allow the three. In Claude Code that is settings.json:

    sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite     ["~/.stim"]
    sandbox.network.allowMachLookup   ["com.apple.coresimulator.*"]
    sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding true

  In Codex the sandbox is one flag, \`codex -s\`, with no per-path allowance:
  workspace-write still refuses STIM_HOME.

  A git credential helper is often blocked too. It prints \`failed to store\`
  on a fetch that otherwise succeeded, and is safe to ignore.`,
