# @stim-cli/cache

The cache provider contract Stim uses for Metro transforms and native build
artifacts, plus the tier coordination, timeout, and warning policy that sit in
front of it.

The local filesystem is always the first tier. A project can add one optional
second tier by pointing `cache.provider` at a module that implements this
contract. Stim ships no network provider; writing one is an addition, not a
change to Stim.

If Stim is not installed globally, replace `stim` with `npx stim`.

## Selecting a provider

```json
{
  "cache": {
    "provider": "./tools/cache-provider.cjs",
    "options": { "bucket": "mobile-cache" }
  }
}
```

The reference is a package name or a path relative to the settings file that
declares it. Commit `.stim.json` beside the app's `package.json`; monorepo apps do
not inherit an ancestor's provider. Machine settings override committed settings, and the
existing nested merge rules apply to `cache.options`. Keep secrets out of
committed settings; read them from the environment or from machine settings.

## Writing a provider

```js
export const apiVersion = 1;

export async function createCacheProvider({ projectRoot, options }) {
  return {
    metro: {
      async get({ key, cacheName, signal }) {
        return null;
      },
      async set({ key, value, cacheName, signal }) {},
    },
    builds: {
      async resolve({ platform, key, destinationDir, signal }) {
        return null;
      },
      async store({ platform, key, sourcePath, overwrite, signal }) {},
    },
  };
}
```

A provider implements one or both capabilities. It owns transport,
serialization, archive format, authentication, and remote retention. Stim owns
fingerprints, cache keys, and local artifact paths.

`metro.get` returns the stored value or `null`.

`builds.resolve` returns an existing path to the artifact, or `null` for a
miss. `destinationDir` is a scratch directory Stim creates and owns: a provider
that fetches the artifact must materialize it there and return a path inside
it, and must leave the directory empty on a miss. The built-in filesystem tier
already holds the artifact, so it returns its own cache path instead.

`builds.store` receives the `.app` directory or `.apk` file that Stim just
built. `overwrite: false` must keep an entry that already exists for the key,
and `overwrite: true` must replace it.

Every call receives an `AbortSignal`. A provider must honor it: Stim abandons
the call at the deadline and keeps building or bundling with the local tier.

`stim gc` never deletes provider data, and the contract has no delete
operation, so shared team or CI data is never removed by a local command.

## Failure rules

Provider failures are cache misses. A timeout, module error, authentication
error, or network error produces one warning per failure class per command or
supervisor run and never fails a bundle, an install, a launch, or a successful
build.

## Contract tests

Run the shipped checks against your own module:

```js
import { runCacheProviderContract } from '@stim-cli/cache';

const results = await runCacheProviderContract({
  provider: await createCacheProvider({ projectRoot, options }),
  projectRoot,
  workDir,
});

for (const result of results) {
  if (!result.passed) throw new Error(`${result.name}: ${result.error}`);
}
```

Pass `providerModule` instead of `provider` to load the module the way Stim
does, which also checks `apiVersion` and the factory:

```js
const results = await runCacheProviderContract({
  providerModule: './tools/cache-provider.cjs',
  projectRoot,
  workDir,
});
```

`cacheProviderContractChecks()` returns the same checks as individual cases for
a test runner that reports each one separately. Both helpers only check the
capabilities a provider advertises, bound every check with a deadline, and
verify that a call settles once its `AbortSignal` aborts.

## Budgets

Every provider call is bounded. The defaults are 2s for a Metro read, 10s for a
Metro write, 30s for a build lookup, 60s for a build upload, and 10s to load the
module. Override any of them per run with an environment variable:

```bash
STIM_CACHE_METRO_READ_TIMEOUT_MS=5000 stim start
STIM_CACHE_BUILD_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS=60000 stim ios
```

The variables are `STIM_CACHE_METRO_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`STIM_CACHE_METRO_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `STIM_CACHE_BUILD_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`STIM_CACHE_BUILD_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `STIM_CACHE_LOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`. Each
takes whole milliseconds; any other value keeps the default.

The tiered Metro store also exposes `flush()`, which resolves once queued
provider writes have drained. Metro never calls it; every in-flight write holds
a referenced deadline, so a Metro process drains on its own within the write
budget. It exists for tests and embedders that own the process.

Metro reads are also capped: at most six can be in flight, and the tier turns
itself off for the rest of the run after five consecutive failures, so a broken
provider costs one round of warnings rather than a timeout per transform.

The npm scope remains `@stim-cli` until the `@stim` scope is available.
