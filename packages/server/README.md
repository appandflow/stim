# @stim-cli/server

`stim-server` serves Stim state to paired read-only clients, such as the Stim
phone app. It runs on the Mac, next to Stim, and changes no Stim state: it
writes only its own pairing state under `$STIM_HOME/server/`.

The design is in
[`docs/specs/2026-09-25-stim-server-design.md`](../../docs/specs/2026-09-25-stim-server-design.md).

## Commands

```bash
stim-server [--port <n>]          # serve paired clients, port 7787 by default
stim-server pair [--port <n>]     # print a single-use pairing payload
stim-server devices [list]        # list paired devices
stim-server devices revoke <id>   # revoke a paired device
```

`pair --json` prints `{ "qr": <payload>, "expiresAt": "<ISO time>" }`, and
`devices --json` prints `{ "devices": [...] }` with each device's `id`, `name`,
`identity`, `pairedAt`, `lastSeenAt` and `capabilities`, never its token hash.

`GET http://127.0.0.1:7787/health` answers requests from this Mac with the
server's name, versions, protocol, `stimHome`, and the Tailscale state it
started with. While Tailscale runs, it also carries `route`, read from
`tailscale serve status --json` on each request: `routed` with the HTTPS
`port` that proxies to the server, `funneled` with the Funnel `ports` that do,
`missing`, or `unknown` with a `reason`; the last three carry the `port` the
setup command would use. Stim Desktop uses it to find a running server and
show its route. A request through
`tailscale serve`, on a Tailscale address, or with a `Host` other than
`127.0.0.1` or `localhost` gets HTTP 426, like any other plain HTTP request.

`stim-server` runs the `stim` version this package was released with, not the
one on your PATH. It reads the login shell's environment once at start, so
`PATH`, `ANDROID_HOME`, and `STIM_*` variables match your terminal even when
another app starts it.

## Tailscale

Tailscale carries and encrypts the traffic between the phone and the Mac, on
the same Wi-Fi or across networks, and identifies each device. Stim adds no
cryptography of its own. You need Tailscale on the Mac and on the phone, in the
same tailnet or with the Mac shared to the phone's user.

`stim-server` listens only on `127.0.0.1` and on the Mac's Tailscale
addresses, never on every interface. Run this once so clients can use
`wss://<mac>.<tailnet>.ts.net:7443` with a valid certificate:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg --https=7443 http://127.0.0.1:7787
```

The dedicated port 7443 keeps the server tailnet only and leaves port 443 to
other apps. Do not serve `stim-server` on a port where Tailscale Funnel is on:
Funnel makes every handler on that port reachable from the public internet.

`stim-server` reads `tailscale serve status --json` at start and on every
`pair`. It uses the HTTPS port whose `/` handler proxies to its loopback port,
preferring 7443. Without such a route, it assumes 7443 and prints the command
above, or the next free port when 7443 is taken. It never suggests a Funnel
port. Any handler, at any path, or TCP forward that reaches the server on a
Funnel port makes it public, and `pair` refuses.

When Tailscale is not running, `stim-server` listens on loopback only and
says so on stderr. Start Tailscale, then restart `stim-server`.

## Pairing

`stim-server pair` prints the JSON that the pairing QR code encodes:

```json
{ "v": 1, "name": "Janic's MacBook Pro", "endpoint": "wss://janics-mbp.tail1234.ts.net:7443", "pairingToken": "..." }
```

The endpoint names the route's port, and omits it for 443. When a route to
the server is on a port with Funnel on, `pair` refuses and exits 1 without
creating a token.

The pairing token works once and expires after 5 minutes. A client spends it in
`hello` and receives a random device token, which it presents on every later
connection. The server stores only the SHA-256 hash of each token.

At pairing, the server records the peer's tailnet node and user from
`tailscale whois`. A device token presented from any other node is refused, so
a leaked token alone is not enough. A device paired over loopback, from this
Mac, is accepted only over loopback. `tailscale serve` connects from loopback
and names the peer in `X-Forwarded-For`, which the server trusts only on
loopback connections. Forward only `tailscale serve` in HTTP mode to the
loopback port: a forwarder that omits that header, such as `tailscale serve
--tcp`, `ssh -L`, or a tunnel, makes every remote peer look like this Mac.

A connection must send `hello` within 5 seconds. Five failed attempts from the
same peer within a minute block new connections from it for up to a minute.

Paired devices live in `$STIM_HOME/server/devices.json`. Revoking a device
closes its open connections.

## Protocol

JSON messages over a WebSocket. Requests are `{ "id", "method", "params" }`,
answered by `{ "id", "result" }` or `{ "id", "error": { "code", "message" } }`.
Events are `{ "event", "subscription", ... }`.

- `hello` must come first. Params: `protocol` (1), `client` (`name`,
  `version`), and `auth`, either `{ "pairingToken", "deviceName" }` or
  `{ "deviceToken" }`. The result carries the server name and versions, the
  granted capabilities (`read` only in protocol 1), the paired device, and the
  new `deviceToken` when the hello paired.
- `status.subscribe` returns a subscription id. Each `status` event carries a
  full payload as `stim status --watch --json` prints it. All subscribers share
  one `stim status --watch --json` child, which stops with the last
  subscriber.
- `logs.query` returns `{ "records" }`, and `logs.subscribe` sends `logs`
  events: first the last `tail` matching records, then new ones in batches.
  Both take the Stim Desktop log viewer's filters: `workspace` (required),
  `sources` (`metro`, `client`, `device`, `build`), `slot`, `level` (the
  minimum), `grep` (a regular expression), `errors`, and `tail` (1 to 5000,
  5000 by default). Without `sources`, `errors` keeps the CLI's default error
  scope. They run `stim logs --json` and `stim logs --json --follow` in the
  workspace. Subscribers with the same workspace and filters share one
  `--follow` child, which stops with the last of them.
- `stats.get` and `settings.get` return the payload of `stim stats --json` and
  `stim settings --json`, which masks sensitive values. Without `workspace`,
  they run in the home directory and cover the machine only.
- `frames.subscribe` takes `workspace`, `platform` (`ios` or `android`) and
  `slot` (`default` when absent) and sends `frame` events: a JPEG screenshot,
  base64 in `data`, with `width`, `height` and `capturedAt`. It serves only a
  booted simulator or a running emulator that `stim status` lists as owned by
  that workspace; any other device ends the subscription with a
  `frames-failed` `error` event, and so does a device that stops or changes
  owner. Simulators are captured with `xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot`, of
  the primary display, or of the default display when that `simctl` does not
  accept `primary`. Emulators are captured through their gRPC `getScreenshot`,
  found through the discovery file and token the emulator writes when Stim
  boots it, scaled to fit 1280 pixels and converted with `sips`. An emulator
  Stim booted before it passed `-grpc` has no endpoint. A frame is sent only
  when the screen changed: up to 5 per second while it changes, backing off to
  one capture per second while it does not, with capturing taking at most half
  of each device's time. All subscribers of a device share one capture loop,
  which sends a new subscriber the latest frame and stops with the last
  subscriber, and at most two captures run at once. A client whose socket has
  more than 1 MiB unsent skips frames and gets the newest once it catches up.
- `unsubscribe` ends a subscription.
- An `error` event ends a subscription whose source failed, or whose client
  fell behind (`slow-client`); subscribe again.

`workspace` is an environment `path` from a status payload. Any other path is
refused with `unknown-workspace` and runs nothing. A connection holds at most
32 subscriptions and runs at most 4 `logs.query`, `stats.get` and
`settings.get` requests at a time. Those requests fail after 60 seconds or
32 MiB of output, and closing the connection stops them. A `stim` child that
ignores SIGTERM gets SIGKILL a second later. A log subscriber whose socket has more than
4 MiB unsent gets no more batches until it catches up; past 20,000
waiting records the server ends that subscription with `slow-client`.

The error codes `unauthorized`, `pairing-expired`, and `protocol-unsupported`
refuse the client until it pairs again or updates; clients retry the others.

The package exports the message types, and the build writes their JSON Schema
to `dist/protocol.schema.json`, exported as `@stim-cli/server/protocol.schema.json`.
