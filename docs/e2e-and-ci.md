# End-to-end tests and CI

Per-workspace runtime state and logs live outside the project tree under
`$STIM_HOME/workspaces/<readable-project-slug>--<16hex-path-digest>/` (by
default `~/.stim/workspaces/...`). Stim does not create a project
`.gitignore` entry for this state.

Stim has three test layers. The unit suite (`pnpm test`, Vitest, more than
2,000 cases across five packages) is the bulk of the coverage. On top of it sit
two end-to-end layers that exercise the _published loop_ rather than individual
functions. The separately built runtime-floor job loads every published ESM
entry point on Node 20.19.4.

## The fast cross-platform e2e

`test/e2e/cache-flow.e2e.js`, run with:

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

Published packages support Node 20.19.4 or later on Node 20, or Node 22.12.0
or later. Repository development, including this suite, uses Node 22.18 or
later. CI runs the suite on Node 22 and 24; the separate runtime-floor job loads
every published entry point under exactly Node 20.19.4. Git is also required.
The suite needs **no Xcode or Android SDK**.
It drives the real CLI and the real cache library end to end under a throwaway
`STIM_HOME` and a throwaway temp repo, so it never touches the machine's real
caches, registry, or checkouts. What it proves:

1. Git creates real linked worktrees at one commit. `stim worktree warm`
   copies missing ignored state from main, preserves existing entries and the
   branch, and keeps stdout empty.
2. Two worktrees of one commit **fingerprint identically when scoped to a
   platform** (the cross-worktree cache premise) -- and diverge under `ios/`
   when a worktree-local path leaks in, which is exactly why the hash is scoped.
3. A build stored under wt1's key **resolves from wt2's key**: a cross-worktree
   cache hit with no compiler. Change a native input in wt2 and the key changes
   and the hit becomes a miss.
4. Two real node processes racing the single-flight build lock: **exactly one
   builds**, the other waits and resolves the artifact the first one stored.
5. `stim worktree remove` refuses a dirty tree, then removes a clean linked
   worktree, warmed or not, without requiring a Stim registry entry. It leaves
   no workspace directories or config entries and retains Git-created branches.

The one non-real piece is the leaf hash function: the real CLI has a direct `@expo/fingerprint` dependency, while this fast suite injects a deterministic platform-scoping stub (`test/e2e/fixtures/fingerprint-stub.mjs`) through the `load` seam. Everything else -- `buildCacheKey`, `storeBuild`, `resolveBuild`, `acquireBuildLock`, the worktree CLI -- is the real library.

## The native e2e

There are three native suites and one shared harness
(`test/e2e/native/harness.mjs`, which owns the fixture creation, the process
wrappers, the cleanup checks and the diagnostics dump so all drivers build and
tear down the same app the same way):

| suite      | driver               | proves                                                  | when                        |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **loop**   | `run-native-e2e.mjs` | the dev loop works end to end                           | nightly, PR label, dispatch |
| **caches** | `run-cache-e2e.mjs`  | each individual cache is engaged, storing and reused    | on demand                   |
| **pool**   | `run-pool-e2e.mjs`   | iOS simulators are parked, evicted, adopted, and reaped | on demand                   |

### The loop suite

`test/e2e/native/run-native-e2e.mjs` codifies `docs/field-test-protocol.md` as
an executable. It creates a real app, runs the real `start` -> `ios|android`
loop against a real simulator/emulator with a real compiler, and proves the
cache actually engages on a second worktree. It is a 2x2 matrix:

```
framework in {bare, expo}   x   platform in {ios, android}
```

bare and expo are not cosmetic variants: bare hosts Metro **in-process**
(`start` mode `bare-inproc`); expo spawns `expo start` as a **child** (mode `expo-child`) and
prebuilds first. The driver asserts the start mode explicitly per variant --
this is the `detectIsExpo` path a field test caught misfiring on a wrapper-less
`app.json`. Per variant it asserts: correct start mode; a cold build produces a
real artifact; the second worktree hits the local cache with **no compile**
(proven from the build log, not just the JSON); and the protocol's five cleanup
checks pass.

It is **slow and occasionally flaky by nature**, so it is not run on every push.
Run one variant by hand:

```bash
node test/e2e/native/run-native-e2e.mjs --framework bare --platform ios
node test/e2e/native/run-native-e2e.mjs --framework expo --platform android
# safe, no device/build: create the fixture then stop
node test/e2e/native/run-native-e2e.mjs --framework expo --platform ios --fixture-only
# print the plan, no side effects
node test/e2e/native/run-native-e2e.mjs --framework bare --platform android --dry-run
```

The fixture-creation commands are version-sensitive; each is overridable with an
env var (`STIM_E2E_BARE_INIT`, `STIM_E2E_EXPO_INIT`) so a runner can adjust
them without touching assertion logic.

### The simulator pool suite

`test/e2e/native/run-pool-e2e.mjs` runs on iOS. With a pool bound of one, it
creates two workspace simulators, proves the first is parked and then evicted,
proves a third workspace adopts the survivor, and finishes by proving
`gc --delete` empties the pool. Run it by hand with:

```bash
node test/e2e/native/run-pool-e2e.mjs --framework expo
node test/e2e/native/run-pool-e2e.mjs --framework bare --dry-run
```

### The cache suite

`test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs` is the executable replacement for the
hand-written cache field passes. Those kept drifting in coverage: one Android
pass never checked Gradle caching at all, a zero-config pass ran iOS-only and
left `--build-cache` unproven, and a broken Expo Metro store shipped through green CI
(#73) because nothing measured the directory it was supposed to be filling.

**The three-part rule.** For every cache it proves three separate things, and
refuses to take one as evidence of another:

- **ENGAGED** -- the flag / setting / record is really there, read back off the
  REAL argv or the REAL log, never re-derived from the suite's idea of what
  Stim should have done.
- **STORES** -- the cache directory actually GREW. A file count before and a
  file count after. **This is the one that matters**: an engaged cache that
  stores nothing looks identical to a working one from every other angle, and
  that is exactly the shape of the old loader-hook bug.
- **REUSED** -- a SECOND workspace got the stored work back.

**The eight checks.**

| `gc-view`           | `gc` can see every cache                                                                | a bare `gc` must list each live cache directory with a size under "Shared build caches (N) - alive, not garbage"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Honesty rules.** Every assertion prints the evidence it checked -- numbers, and
quoted lines. A check that cannot run SKIPS with the reason spelled out ("no
Android SDK on this runner", "compilation caching needs Xcode 26+, this runner
reports ..."), and a skip is never a pass. A check that finishes without
reporting a verdict is a failure. Every human line goes to stderr; **stdout
carries exactly one line**, the machine-readable summary:

```json
{"suite":"caches","variant":"expo-ios","ok":true,"counts":{"pass":6,"skip":2,"fail":0},"checks":[...]}
```

Each `checks[]` entry carries its `id`, `status`, `reason` and the full
`evidence` array, so a CI job can fail on one cache without a human reading the
log.

**Cache roots are forced, not inherited.** Unlike the loop suite -- which lets
CI persist `STIM_BUILD_CACHE` across runs on purpose, and has
`STIM_E2E_WARM_CACHE` to relax its cold-miss assertion -- the cache suite
overrides `STIM_BUILD_CACHE` and `STIM_METRO_CACHE` into its own throwaway
home. Every number it reports is a before/after around a COLD compile, and an
inherited warm cache turns "the CAS gained 4,000 files" into a measurement of
nothing.

Run it by hand:

```bash
# the full suite (two cold compiles plus two cache-hit builds; 20-60 minutes)
node test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs --framework expo --platform ios
node test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs --framework bare --platform android

# skip the single-flight race (saves one cold compile; that check reports SKIP)
node test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs --framework expo --platform ios --skip-race

# warm-cache parity: use a previously built disposable source checkout with matching Pods
node test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs --framework expo --platform ios \
  --app-dir /tmp/my-app-fixture --summary /tmp/cache-summary.json

# print the plan, no side effects
node test/e2e/native/run-cache-e2e.mjs --framework bare --platform ios --dry-run
```

See the [source-fixture preparation requirements](./field-test-protocol.md#use-a-fixture-that-looks-like-a-real-repo).

On CI it is `workflow_dispatch` only: **Actions -> Native E2E -> Run workflow ->
suite: `caches`** (or `all` for both). The default stays `loop`, so the nightly
and the PR label behave exactly as they always have.

#### What its first run found

Recorded so that the contracts behind the suite are not mysterious. First full local run,
2026-08-27, `expo-ios`, Expo SDK 57 / RN 0.86 / Xcode 26.6, 769s:
`xcode-cas`, `fingerprint-cache`, `single-flight` and `pods-reuse` PASS,
`gradle-cache` SKIP (iOS), and two checks exposed product bugs that are now
fixed:

- **`metro-store` (fixed)** -- the old Expo implementation intercepted Node's
  module loader and missed Expo's vendored Metro path. Expo SDK 54+'s
  `EXPO_OVERRIDE_METRO_CONFIG` now loads a small adapter instead, so the project
  config is composed through an explicit config seam and no module interception
  remains. SDK 53 and older intentionally use Expo's normal Metro cache.
- **`gc-view` (fixed)** -- the Xcode compilation cache and Gradle build cache
  are detected and reported with their ownership-safe cleanup policies.

## CI

Two workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **`ci.yml`** -- fast and **blocking** on every push to `main` and every pull request. The
  repository build matrix uses Node 22 and 24, runs frozen pnpm install, lint,
  format check, ESM build, typecheck, knip, Vitest, and the cross-platform E2E.
  A separate job builds on Node 22.18 and then runs `test/runtime-floor.mjs`
  under exactly Node 20.19.4, the published Node 20 floor. Published packages
  also support Node 22.12 or later; repository development needs Node 22.18 or
  later because tsdown has the higher floor.

- **`e2e-native.yml`** -- the native matrix. **Gated**: it runs nightly
  (schedule), on demand (`workflow_dispatch`), and on a pull request **only when
  the PR carries the `e2e-native` label** -- a flaky 15-minute `xcodebuild` must
  not block every PR. A `suite` dispatch input picks which driver runs on the
  matrix (`loop` | `caches` | `all`, default `loop`); `inputs` is empty on
  schedule and on `pull_request`, so both fall through to `loop` and the
  nightly's behaviour is preserved by construction rather than by a second code
  path. The `caches` selection raises the job timeout to 120 minutes (per
  variant it pays one more cold compile than the loop suite -- the single-flight
  race -- plus two cache-hit builds, and on Android one forced `gradlew` run)
  and uploads its machine-readable summary
  as an artifact with `if: always()` -- a FAILING cache run is exactly when the
  per-check evidence is worth reading. iOS runs on `macos-latest` (Xcode via
  `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode`); Android runs on a Linux+KVM host via
  `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner`. Each platform's `{bare, expo}` are a
  matrix, so they run as parallel, isolated jobs. `~/.stim`'s shared build
  cache (`STIM_BUILD_CACHE`) is persisted across runs with `actions/cache`, so
  the cross-run cache path is itself exercised; build logs
  (`build-*.ndjson`) are uploaded as artifacts on failure.

### Assumptions a reviewer must confirm

- The `macos-latest` runner image ships the Xcode that `latest-stable` selects,
  and it is new enough for the RN/Expo template the fixture creates.
- The `@react-native-community/cli` and `create-expo-app` flag surfaces in the
  driver's `FIXTURE_COMMANDS` match the versions the runners fetch (override via
  the env vars above if not).
- The Android job's `api-level` / `target` / `arch` have a matching system image
  available to `android-emulator-runner`.
- **Disk, for the `caches` suite only.** It stands up FOUR worktrees, each with
  its own global workspace DerivedData / Gradle build dir under `STIM_HOME`, and
  `--keep` leaves them for the artifact step. A hosted runner's free space is
  the thing most likely to end that run early; if it does, `--skip-race` drops
  it to two worktrees at the cost of the `single-flight` and `pods-reuse`
  checks (both of which then report SKIP with that reason).

### Android emulator recycling

After `pnpm run build`, run the pool smoke test against an existing debuggable APK:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types test/e2e/native/run-android-pool-e2e.mjs /absolute/path/app-debug.apk
```

It creates an owned emulator in a temporary Stim home, records fresh and adopted
setup timings, seeds and clears app data, verifies an unchanged APK skips
installation, and checks that GC deletes the parked AVD. It uses separate launch
and cleanup processes, like the CLI. The test removes its own devices and prints
the temporary directory containing `result.json` and emulator logs.
