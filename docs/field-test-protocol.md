# Stim field-test protocol

A handoff document for an AI agent testing Stim end to end on a real
repository. The deliverable is equal parts "does it work" and a **friction
log** — every rough edge, confusing output, wrong default, or extra step you
needed, however small. You are the target user: an agent doing a dev loop.
Be adversarial. **A PASS you did not actually observe is worse than a FAIL.**

## Setup

Choose exactly one CLI under test and use the `stim` function for every command
in this protocol.

For a pre-tag release gate, run from the Stim repository root after the
build step:

```bash
candidate_cli="$PWD/packages/stim-cli/dist/cli.mjs"
stim() { node "$candidate_cli" "$@"; }
stim --version
stim guide agent
stim guide lifecycle
stim guide settings
```

The candidate path is absolute so the function still uses that build after you
change into an app or worktree.

For a standalone field pass of the published release:

```bash
published_version=$(npm view stim version)
stim() { npx "stim@$published_version" "$@"; }
test "$(stim --version)" = "$published_version"
npx skills add appandflow/stim
stim guide agent
stim guide lifecycle
stim guide settings
```

If this machine ran an earlier build of Stim: BEFORE anything else, run
`stim status` and `stim gc` (report-only) and read both skeptically — compatibility
against state an earlier build wrote is not guaranteed. Old cache dirs
(`~/.stim-build-cache`, `~/.<name>-metro-cache`) are dead and ignored;
stale device records should surface in `gc`, not crash anything. Anything
odd here is a HIGH-severity finding.

## Use a fixture that looks like a real repo

A fresh `create-expo-app` has never been prebuilt, so its `app.json` carries no
`ios.bundleIdentifier` / `android.package` and its `package.json` still has the
`expo start` scripts. The first prebuild writes all three -- TRACKED files --
which moves the fingerprint and makes a cold worktree miss a cache entry it
would otherwise hit. A real CNG repo has those values committed (Expo
recommends setting them explicitly), so prebuild writes nothing tracked and a
cold worktree hits on its first lookup; a bare repo commits `ios/` and
`android/` outright and never prebuilds at all.

Before testing caching across worktrees, choose a commit that already contains
the representative identifiers and native inputs. For a throwaway fixture,
prepare and commit those inputs before declaring the baseline. Never prebuild
or commit in a user's main checkout. Otherwise the fixture manufactures a
transition that few users see, and the result reads as a product bug. Test the
cold/warm split deliberately only when it is the behavior under test.

For warm-cache parity, use a disposable main checkout that has completed a
normal native build for the tested platform and configuration, and record that
build and its clean tracked baseline before warming linked worktrees.
Dependency installation and native setup alone can leave first-build generated
inputs unsettled. Prepare under a separate `STIM_HOME`; do not reuse it as the
suite's `--home`, whose dedicated caches must start empty.

## Safety rules (non-negotiable)

- NEVER modify the target repo's main checkout. Worktrees only.
- NEVER run `gc --delete`, `gc --delete --cache all`, or
  `gc --delete --cache <name>` without the user's explicit approval in this
  session. Bare `gc` (report) is always fine.
- Touch no simulator/emulator except `stim-*` ones YOUR runs created.
- No raw `simctl recordVideo` (it can wedge a machine with a global lock);
  record only through your device tool's own mechanism, prefer screenshots.
- No commits or pushes in the user's repos. Clean up everything you create.

## The test script

Deviate when reality demands it — and log why as a friction.

1. **Orient.** `status` (what is already on this machine), `doctor` in the
   app dir (report findings; judge whether each is true of this repo).
2. **Workspace.** Create the linked worktree with
   `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> <ref>`, then `cd <path>` and run
   `stim worktree warm`. Skip Git creation if the harness already did it.
   Confirm the branch and commit with Git, and record warm's copied, kept,
   and failed entry counts. Install deps with the repo's OWN tooling (read its docs;
   monorepos: work from the app directory, but install per the repo's rules).
3. **Dev server.** `stim start --json`. Assert: correct mode
   (`expo-child` for Expo apps, `bare-inproc` for bare RN — a wrong detection
   here is CRITICAL), the global readable workspace directory created under
   `~/.stim/workspaces/<project>--<digest>/`, second
   `start` a no-op, `status` shows the supervisor healthy.
4. **Build.** `stim ios` (and/or `android`). Cold: watch the phase
   lines; on failure judge the extracted diagnostic against the raw log in
   `~/.stim/workspaces/<project>--<digest>/logs/build-*.ndjson` — was it enough to act on? Assert the
   `--json` payload against the launch-status table below. `"unverified"` is
   not automatically a failure, but it requires following Stim's own
   remedy and recording what the device actually did.
5. **Interact.** Drive the app with your device tool (snapshot, screenshot,
   a few taps), targeting YOUR sim by udid, never "booted". No real logins.
6. **Logs.** `logs --errors` on the healthy app (near-empty, exit 0, no OS
   syslog noise). Then break the bundle on purpose (rename an imported
   file), reload, and assert the failure SURFACES in `--errors`; fix it and
   assert it stops being reported after the next bundle. `status`'s error
   count must stay sane throughout.
7. **Cache proof.** Run the applicable native cache suite from
   `docs/e2e-and-ci.md` and attach its machine-readable summary. It separately
   proves ENGAGED, STORES, and REUSED for every cache. On a real repository,
   still verify the second worktree installs without compiling; do not repeat
   the suite's directory-counting script by hand.
8. **Teardown.** `stop` in each, then `worktree remove` each — with NO
   `--force` and NO manual `rm`. A refusal you cannot resolve by following
   the message's own remedy is a HIGH finding. A retained Git-created branch
   is expected; it is not evidence of failed workspace removal.
9. **Verify cleanup**, all five:
   - `xcrun simctl list devices | grep Stim` → none of yours remain
     (`emulator -list-avds` likewise on Android)
   - `ps aux | grep -E 'Stim|supervisor'` → no supervisors or collectors
   - `stim status` → your workspaces gone from the registry
   - `git -C <repo> status --porcelain` and `git worktree list` → main
     checkout byte-identical to before you started (capture a baseline!)
   - bare `stim gc` → nothing orphaned that you created

## Manual gaps beyond the native suites

The automated `loop` and `caches` suites own fresh bare/Expo fixtures, cache
growth and reuse, Pods reuse, single-flight, and `gc` visibility. Manual work
is only for shapes the release actually changes and automation cannot model.

For a cached release, use a unique JS sentinel. On iOS, confirm the copied and
re-signed `.app` contains the regenerated bundle. On Android, confirm the APK
bundle remains stored rather than deflated, is zipaligned and signed, and that
a changed asset set refuses the swap and falls back to a full build.

### The staged physical-iPhone checklist

Everything on this list needs a phone and nothing else does, so it is staged
rather than run every release. Design and reasoning:
`docs/specs/2026-09-01-ios-device-release-design.md`.

**A. The re-seal acceptance test** (the spec's riskiest unverified assumption;
run it first, before anything downstream is trusted). Take any signed device
`.app`, mutate its `ip.txt`, re-seal it with Stim's ladder, then:

```
codesign --verify --strict <app>   ->   devicectl device install   ->   launch
```

Record the verify output, the install result, and whether the app ran. A
failure here invalidates `ip.txt` ownership, the Debug path, and the Release
JS swap together, so report it as CRITICAL and stop.

**PASSED 2026-09-01** on an iPhone 12 Pro (iPhone13,3, cabled, iOS Developer
Mode on), against the real `stim ios --device` artifact: the mutation broke the
seal, `codesign --force --sign <sha1>
--preserve-metadata=identifier,entitlements,flags,runtime` re-made it,
`--verify --strict` passed, and both install and launch were accepted. A
pristine control behaved identically. Rerun it only when the re-seal ladder
itself changes.

**B. Device log capture** (appandflow/stim#179). The collector's parser is
tested against a real `os_log` stderr mirror captured on macOS, not on a
phone. What a phone has to settle:

1. **Fields observed live vs. the fixtures.** Run the collector against the
   app and quote real lines from `device.ndjson`. Confirm each claim the
   `guide logs` table makes: `ts` is the device's own clock and not the
   host's; `proc` is `name(pid)`; `category` is present for React Native's
   `javascript` / `native` calls and absent for `NSLog`; `subsystem` is
   absent; and an `os_log` call made at the error level is **still recorded
   at info**, which is the loss the guide claims. A field that survives on
   hardware but is documented as lost is a HIGH finding, not a bonus.
2. **The os_log mirror actually mirrors.** Without `OS_ACTIVITY_DT_MODE` the
   stream carries plain `stdout`/`stderr` writes only. Prove the variable is
   doing work: a `console.log` from JS must appear. If it does not, the
   collector is capturing almost nothing and the gap is still open.
3. **Timeline integration.** `logs --source device` shows the records in one
   timeline with `metro` and `build`, ordered by `ts` across sources.
   `logs --errors` with no `--source` still excludes them. A native crash
   before JS starts appears with level `fatal`.
4. **Launch coupling.** On hardware the collector performs the launch, so
   confirm exactly one app instance starts, that `--terminate-existing`
   replaced a running one, and that a dev-client deep link passed as
   `--payload-url` opened the right URL.
5. **Cleanup on unplug.** Pull the cable with the collector running. It must
   remove its own `collectors.ios` registration and exit; `status` must stop
   reporting it and `gc` must find nothing, because a phone is never recorded
   as a device. Then reconnect and run `ios --device` again: the replacement
   must start cleanly. **Which closing record does it write?** A non-zero
   devicectl exit becomes `collector_failed`, a zero exit becomes
   `collector_stopped`, and nobody has observed which one a cable-pull
   produces. Record the exit code and the record. If unplugging reports a
   failure, that is a wrong error on a normal action and the classification
   needs to change.
6. **Replacement and ownership.** With a collector live, run `ios --device`
   again and confirm the previous pid was proven this workspace's and
   signalled, and that `stop` reaps the survivor.

**C. Install, launch and Debug over the LAN** (#178 phases 3 and 5). What a
phone has to settle, and what is already settled:

1. **The dev-client Debug loop, end to end.** `stim ios --device` on a
   provisioned expo-dev-client project: cache HIT on the `-device` key, install,
   launch through the collector with the deep link on `--payload-url`, a bundle
   request from the phone in `logs --source metro`, and `launched: true`.
   **PASSED 2026-09-01** on the phone above.
2. **The device pid, never a host pid.** The run's `launch` line names a pid read
   from `devicectl device info processes`, and a Release run's proof is that
   probe repeated, not `process.kill`. **PASSED 2026-09-01** for Debug;
   `verifyIosDeviceReleaseLaunch` itself has not run on hardware.
3. **The two human, one-time steps.** A first launch of a build whose developer
   the phone has not trusted is refused with `FBSOpenApplicationErrorDomain 3`
   and reason `Security`; the remedy must name Settings > General > VPN & Device
   Management first. The Local Network permission prompt must be tapped before
   the phone can reach Metro at all; it cannot be pre-granted from the host and
   it survives an upgrade install. **Both OBSERVED 2026-09-01**; the refusal
   classifier is unit-tested against the recorded text rather than re-provoked.
4. **The bare `ip.txt` path.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: it needs a bare RN
   project with a development profile that names the phone, and the available
   one is a dev-client app. On-disk verification (the copy carries
   `<addr>:<port>`, the cache entry does not, the copy re-seals and verifies)
   plus RN's own producer/consumer (`react-native-xcode.sh:16-28`,
   `RCTBundleURLProvider.mm:70,206`) is what stands behind it today. A phone run
   is the outstanding evidence.
5. **The signer-conflict uninstall-and-retry.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: a
   genuine `MismatchedApplicationIdentifierEntitlement` needs a second signing
   team. The classifier and the one-uninstall-one-retry ladder are unit-tested
   against Apple's documented text.
6. **The Release device run.** Builds fresh every time until the device JS swap
   lands (phase 6), because a cached Release app carries its builder's JS.
   Prove `metroPort` is null, no LAN machinery runs, and the process is alive on
   the phone three seconds after launch.
7. **The app dies with its collector.** `stop` (or `gc --delete`, or pulling the
   cable) ends the collector, and because the collector is the launch, the app
   closes on the phone. Confirm the app is still INSTALLED, that `status` and
   `gc` report no device, and that the next `ios --device` starts it again.
   **OBSERVED 2026-09-01**: SIGTERM to the collector alone terminates the app.
8. **An uninstall costs the developer trust.** After any uninstall -- including
   the signer-conflict retry -- the next launch is refused until the trust is
   granted again, and the Local Network permission has to be re-tapped.
   **OBSERVED 2026-09-01** (issue #178).
9. **The pending Local Network permission, detected and recovered.**
   **OBSERVED 2026-09-01** (issue #198), on the phone above with Metro on 8082.
   `stim ios --device --json` returned `"launched":"unverified"` with pid 909
   while the prompt was up, and the device log carried the signature for the
   whole time: at 23:12:53, `Connection 1: failed to connect 1:50`,
   `error code: -1009 [1:50]`, and `Code=-1009 ... _kCFStreamErrorCodeKey=50`
   with `_NSURLErrorNWPathKey=unsatisfied (Local network prohibited)`. Only that
   last path reason is matched: the errno-50 lines are generic and Wi-Fi being
   off produces them with `unsatisfied (No network route)`. Sixteen lines of the
   capture are the classifier's fixture. Recovery, in order:
   `agent-device alert get` read
   `Allow "Trailhead" to find devices on local networks?` before any `open`;
   `alert accept` returned `accepted` and a second
   `alert get` found none; no bundle request followed within 20 s, because the
   dev client stayed on its error screen; `snapshot -i` showed
   `[button] "Reload"` and `agent-device press 'label="Reload"'` produced Metro
   `iOS Bundled 75ms` at 23:15:20 with the app running. The devicectl
   `--terminate-existing --payload-url` relaunch also recovers (twice), at the
   cost of the collector's process. `agent-device metro reload` does not: it
   needs `--metro-host`/`--metro-port` on a phone and still does nothing to an
   app that never connected. NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: the same detection and
   recovery on a BARE app, which needs a provisioned bare project, and the
   DENIED case -- a prior Don't Allow logs the identical path reason, so the
   remedy covers it, but nobody has provoked it on hardware.

### The staged device-lease checklist

Every item needs a phone and a second workspace on the same machine. Design
and reasoning: `docs/specs/2026-09-02-device-lease-design.md`. Set up two
workspaces of one project sharing the phone: the checkout as A with its own
Metro, and a Git-created linked worktree as B. Run `stim worktree warm` in B
to copy missing ignored state from main. Both checkouts need signing settings
valid for their tracked source; warm does not copy tracked changes.

**D. Device leases.**

1. **A declared lease blocks a run and names itself.** In A, `stim device
lock ios --for 5m`; in B, `stim ios --device --wait 10`. B prints a waiting
   line naming A, the device, and A's expiry, then refuses `STIM_DEVICE_BUSY`
   with the same facts and the three remedies, and installs nothing.
   **PASSED 2026-09-02** on an iPhone 12 Pro (iPhone13,3, cabled): the wait ran
   10 s (the countdown went 4m56s to 4m46s between the waiting line and the
   refusal); the busy `--json` carried the `lease` object.
2. **`--no-wait` bypasses and says what it costs.** With A's lease still held,
   B runs `stim ios --device --no-wait`. A warning (two `lease` lines) names A
   and its expiry and, when the app ids match, says the install terminates
   A's app; the run installs, launches, reports `lease: null`, and A's lease
   file is untouched.
   **PASSED 2026-09-02**: cache hit, `launched: true`, 8.4 s; A still had a
   lease to `unlock` afterwards; the same-app-id sentence printed because both
   workspaces build `com.appandflow.trailhead`. Whether A's app closed on the
   phone was not checked; A had no run of its own in flight.
3. **A run leases for itself and lets go.** After `stim device unlock` in A,
   B runs `stim ios --device`. While the run holds the device (install through
   verification), `stim status` from A lists a lease held by B with
   `mine: false`; after the run the file is gone and the run's `--json`
   carries `lease: { kind: "run", expiresAt }`.
   **PASSED 2026-09-02**: `lease: { kind: "run", expiresAt:
"2026-09-02T06:54:18.461Z" }`, 7.8 s; the mid-run status listing
   (`mine: false`) and the empty lock directory afterwards were OBSERVED from
   A and not saved.
4. **Expiry frees the device.** In A, `stim device lock ios --for 10s`; in B,
   `stim ios --device --wait 30`. B waits out the eight or so seconds and
   proceeds. **PASSED 2026-09-02** (16 s total, `launched: true`).
5. **The pool with one phone.** With A holding a lease, `stim device lock ios
--wait 5` in B (no id) waits, then refuses `STIM_DEVICE_BUSY` naming every
   holder ("Every connected device is leased by another workspace"). After A
   unlocks, the same command grants B the phone by pool selection, and B's
   id-less `stim ios --device` rides that declared lease: the run raises it
   per step and leaves it, so `status` still lists B's lease after the run and
   the run's `--json` says `kind: "declared"`. **PASSED 2026-09-02**: the
   refusal read "Every connected device is leased by another workspace, and
   this run waited 5s for one"; the id-less run then printed "declared lease
   on 00008101-000A10913C89001E until 2026-09-02T07:01:24.449Z" (five minutes
   from the install step, so the raise happened) and launched. The
   `kind: "declared"` payload and the lingering status entry were read in the
   session, not saved.
6. **Two-device ordering.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: it needs two connected
   phones. Expected: an id-less run takes the lower case-folded UDID, and a
   workspace holding a lease on the higher one lands there instead. The
   selection is unit-tested; only the real listing order is unproven.
7. **A held phone, unplugged.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE, and one phone is
   enough: with B holding a lease, pull the cable, then B's id-less
   `stim ios --device` must refuse `STIM_NO_DEVICE` naming the leased UDID
   rather than the generic no-device message; `stim device unlock` in B clears
   it.
8. **A lease stolen mid-run.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: nothing takes a live
   lease without deleting its file, so this is a deliberate provocation. From
   A, wait for B's `lease   run lease on ...` line, then remove
   `$STIM_HOME/device-locks/ios-<udid>.json` and run `stim device lock ios` at
   once. If A lands before B's install raise, B refuses `STIM_DEVICE_LOST`
   and installs nothing; if A lands during the install or launch, B prints one
   `lease` warning that the app is already installed and continues, and its
   `--json` says `lease: null`. The two-process protocol test covers both
   paths; neither has been seen on a phone.
9. **A corrupt lease file on a real listing.** NOT YET RUN ON HARDWARE: write
   garbage into the phone's lease file, then an id-less run must refuse
   `STIM_DEVICE_BUSY` naming the file rather than treat the phone as free, and
   `stim gc` must report the file without deleting it.

| `false`        | Reserved; Stim does not produce it today.                                                      | Treat its appearance as a contract regression.                                                     |

## The friction log (the primary deliverable)

Number every finding. For each: **severity** (critical / high / med / low),
the **verbatim evidence** (the exact output line, not a paraphrase), and a
**one-line suggested fix**. Classify honestly:

- CRITICAL: the documented loop cannot complete unassisted, or Stim
  reported success for something that failed, or wrong-workspace
  cross-contamination of any kind.
- HIGH: a wrong or unactionable error message; a query that hides real
  signal; destructive-path surprises.
- MED: false positives/negatives in doctor/setup checks; misleading
  defaults.
- LOW: noise, cosmetics, missing progress output.

## Report structure

(a) matrix rows run and omitted, with reasons; (b) friction log; (c) what
worked cleanly; (d) timings table; (e) attached loop results/logs and cache JSON
summaries; (f) manual-row evidence; (g) device-interaction evidence; (h) the five cleanup
checks with output; (i) bugs with minimal repros; (j) the repo shape (Expo or
bare, SDK, package manager, mono or single, flavored or not). A skip is never
a pass, and every claimed pass includes a quoted line, measured value, or
artifact inspection.
