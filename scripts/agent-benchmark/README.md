# Agent benchmark driver

This is the executable coordinator used by the published agent benchmarks. It
keeps machine-local pins, credentials, build artifacts, raw transcripts, and
device identifiers outside the repository while keeping fixture preparation,
dispatch, evidence collection, audit, cleanup, and reporting reviewable.

The driver runs the iOS and Android readiness suites plus the iOS JavaScript
launch-failure suite described in [`../../docs/agent-benchmark.md`](../../docs/agent-benchmark.md).
Runs are sequential. Never dispatch two cells against the same benchmark root.

## Machine-local layout

Create a benchmark root outside the repository with these entries:

```text
benchmark-root/
  bin/stim
  golden/
  pins.env
  targets.json
  runtime/node_modules/stim-cli/
  results/
  state/
```

`bin/stim` is an executable shim for the pinned `stim-cli` in `runtime`.
`pins.env` contains the exact fixture, CLI, agent-device, OS, Xcode, Node, and
CocoaPods values checked by `preflight`; use the keys read by `versionChecks`
in `driver.mjs`. `targets.json` defines this machine's timing expectations for
each platform, change, and arm:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "machine": "Mac mini, Apple M4, 16 GB",
  "targets": {
    "android.native.stim": {
      "screenReadySeconds": 300,
      "platformCommandSeconds": 180,
      "ccacheMinHitRatePercent": 50,
      "runTimeoutSeconds": 600
    },
    "android.native.control": {
      "screenReadySeconds": 600,
      "runTimeoutSeconds": 900
    }
  }
}
```

Every dispatched cell needs an entry. `screenReadySeconds` is reported as a
performance target but does not invalidate a slow model. A Stim platform
command over `platformCommandSeconds` is an invalid machine/build result.
`runTimeoutSeconds` terminates and invalidates a runaway agent. Keep
authentication and raw evidence out of Git.

Android native Stim cells also require `ccacheMinHitRatePercent`. Establish this
machine/scenario threshold from a verified warm compiler-cache probe before
dispatch; the example value is illustrative. Keep it fixed across models.
Collection records actual hits and misses, accepts proven artifact hits without
C++ compilation, and flags missing or below-target compiler-cache evidence.
Completed tool output triggers an immediate `CACHE ALERT` and preserves
`cache-alerts.json`. A flagged attempt stays available for investigation and is
excluded from published comparisons; investigate the cause before retrying.

Android golden preparation and every preflight require a structured doctor
report without cost findings. Repair the fixture with
`stim doctor --fix --platform android`, seed its shared caches, and verify
cross-worktree reuse before creating the golden. Preflight only inspects the
fixture; it never changes cache state during a timed cell.

Set the machine-local paths explicitly:

```bash
export STIM_BENCH_ROOT=/path/to/benchmark-root
export STIM_BENCH_FIXTURE=/path/to/clean-trailhead-checkout
export STIM_BENCH_WORKTREE_PARENT=/path/to/benchmark-worktrees
export STIM_BENCH_STIM_PACKAGE="$STIM_BENCH_ROOT/runtime/node_modules/stim-cli"
export STIM_BENCH_CODEX_AUTH=/path/to/codex-auth.json
export STIM_BENCH_SKILLS_ROOT=/path/to/skills
```

`STIM_BENCH_CODEX_BIN`, `STIM_BENCH_CLAUDE_BIN`, and
`STIM_BENCH_AGENT_DEVICE_BIN` can pin non-default executable paths.

Preflight runs the pinned Stim shim through the same isolated login-shell
startup used by timed commands. Dispatch refuses a Stim version, executable,
or CLI digest mismatch and refuses a control shell that can resolve Stim.
Golden cache validation hashes the fixture with the pinned CLI's fingerprint
dependency, not the fixture's potentially different version.

Both runners are launched through macOS `sandbox-exec` with a verified,
run-scoped policy. Configuration, golden files, coordinator evidence and
sibling worktrees/results cannot be read or written by the runner process tree.
Parent-directory listing is permitted. The current worktree, proof, temporary
files, runner home, selected tool runtime and configured shared Gradle/AVD/device
state remain accessible. Keep those shared paths narrowly scoped; dispatch
refuses a grant that exposes the protected coordinator probes. Do not use a
protected coordinator directory as a shared cache root.

`smoke stim` and `smoke control` verify real filesystem denials and the Codex
skill profile without running a model task. Timed dispatch repeats the same
checks before starting the clock and records the policy digest. This is a
macOS benchmark-data boundary, not a security sandbox for hostile code or
already-running native services. Unsupported hosts fail closed.

## Run a cell

Prepare the platform golden, then dispatch, collect, and clean one cell:

```bash
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs preflight
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs prepare
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs dispatch gpt-5.6-sol stim launch-crash sol-launch-crash
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs collect /path/to/run-directory
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs cleanup /path/to/run-directory
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs report sol-launch-crash
```

Android is selected explicitly and remains a separate result block:

```bash
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs preflight android
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs prepare android
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs dispatch gpt-5.6-sol stim javascript sol-android android
```

`dispatch` creates and commits the broken fixture before the timed turn, gives
the agent the fixture checkout as its starting directory, and requires the
agent to create the measured run worktree itself. `collect` rejects source
inspection before launch/error capture, a missing exact repair, a missing
mismatched device, missing Settings-screen proof, failed Stim guide or warm
setup, dependency installation inside the timer, missing Gradle cache injection,
or exceeded machine phase target. The recovery mechanism is measured, not
prescribed.

Run the self-tests before a campaign:

```bash
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs selftest-device-targeting
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs selftest-agent-device-isolation
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs selftest-launch-crash
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs selftest-android
node scripts/agent-benchmark/driver.mjs selftest-runner-timeout
```
